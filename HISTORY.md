# Project history

Phase-by-phase record of what was built, when, and what was verified. Pairs
with `continue.md` (forward-looking handoff) and `docs/v2_layers.md` (v2
sketches).

## 2026-05-08 — v1 prototype: Phases 1–4 + 6

Worked through the spec in `continue.md` (revision 2). Phase 5 (yacv viewer)
deferred; everything else complete.

### Phase 1 — Container + DB scaffold ✅

- `Dockerfile` `FROM ghcr.io/derhuerst/build123d` (digest-pinned, `:with_yacv`
  variant, `--platform=linux/amd64`).
- `compose.yaml` defines `cad` and `viewer` services sharing the same
  locally-built image.
- Vendored `ltree_sqlite.c` and compiled to `/usr/local/lib/ltree.so` *inside*
  the container during build. **Reason**: the host-vendored `ltree.so` is
  aarch64 and won't dlopen under qemu-amd64; SQLite's "no such file" error in
  that case is misleading.
- `src/mk/db.py` opens SQLite, loads ltree, runs `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
  for the existing KB tables plus a new `geometry(hash, brep_blob)` table.
- `mk init` verified end-to-end against the container.

### Phase 2 — Manifest API + apply ✅

- `src/mk/kb.py` provides `connect()`, `kb_part`, `kb_asm` context managers
  built on top of `KnowledgeBaseManager` from
  `vendor/kb_python/knowledge_base_manager.py`.
- `mk apply <manifest.py>` dynamically imports the manifest; the `connect()`
  context picks up `MK_DB` and threads the connection via `contextvars`.
- Sentinel labels (`PART`, `JOINT`, `PARAM`, `META`, `SUB`, `INST`, `MATE`)
  populated correctly. Path layout matches spec §5.1.
- Verified against `tests/fixtures/single_part.py` and
  `tests/fixtures/two_part_asm.py`.

### Phase 3 — Builder runner + STEP export ✅

- `src/mk/builder.py` reads `PART.body.properties.source`, compiles + execs
  into a fresh namespace with `from build123d import *` already applied,
  calls the entry function with the merged param dict.
- `src/mk/geometry.py` has `shape_to_step_bytes`, `shape_to_brep_bytes`,
  `brep_bytes_to_shape`, `geometry_hash`. Uses tempfile + disk for OCC
  serialization (stable across OCP versions; cost negligible).
- `mk build <asm>` walks INST rows, runs builders, caches BREP keyed by
  sha256 of STEP bytes, writes `geom_hash` back to INST `properties`.
- `mk export <asm> step` produces a valid ISO-10303-21 STEP file.

### Phase 4 — Mass properties + BOM ✅

- `src/mk/commands/mass.py` uses `OCP.BRepGProp.VolumeProperties_s` and
  `GProp_GProps.Add(item, density)` to combine instances with parallel-axis
  weighting. Honors `INST.location` (translation) per the existing schema.
- Units convention documented in `README.md`: mm / mm³ / g/cm³ / g / g·mm².
- Sanity test: `Box(10,10,10)` with density 1 → mass `1.0000 g` exact;
  diagonal inertia `m·a²/6 = 16.667 g·mm²` exact.
- `src/mk/commands/bom.py` is the spec §9 "killer query" — one
  `GROUP BY json_extract(properties, '$.ref_kb')`.

### Phase 6 — Rigid mate solver ✅

- `src/mk/mate.py` parses joint paths of the form
  `<asm>.INST.<inst>.JOINT.<joint>`, looks up frames in the inst's referenced
  part KB, computes a rotation (via `gp_Quaternion.SetRotation(vec1, vec2)`)
  and translation that places joint A coincident with joint B with
  z-axes opposing.
- Schema extension: `INST.properties.location` now optionally carries a
  `rot` 3×3 rotation matrix alongside `loc`. Pre-Phase-6 manifests still work.
- `src/mk/transform.py` is the shared helper that turns the location dict
  into a `gp_Trsf` (or build123d `Location`); `mass.py` and `export.py` both
  consume it.
- `mk build` runs `mate.solve_assembly` before iterating INSTs, so a single
  `mk build asm_demo` covers `apply → mate → build → export`.
- Verified: bolt's `thread_tip` lands at the bracket's `hole_top.origin`
  with z-axes opposing. Total mass unchanged (rigid transforms preserve it);
  bolt CoM transforms by exactly the math the rotation predicts.

### Operational notes from this session

- A previous session crashed WSL by running `multiarch/qemu-user-static
  --reset -p yes`, which registered a `qemu-aarch64` binfmt handler on an
  aarch64 host — every `bash` invocation got intercepted and re-run through
  `qemu-aarch64-static`, an aarch64 binary, recursively. Outcome: ENOEXEC
  cascade, WSL killed by Hyper-V, lost work. Recovery: WSL rebooted on its
  own, binfmt state cleared. Saved as a feedback memory so this doesn't
  recur. Docker Desktop's pre-existing `x86_64`-only binfmt handler is
  sufficient for our amd64 builds — no `multiarch/qemu-user-static` needed.

## 2026-05-09 — v1 baseline + real-world evaluation #1: window-controller test rig

First evaluation scenario: an N20 worm gearmotor on an HDPE plate driving a
30° lever arm — a digital twin for testing automotive window-controller
software. New manifest at `project/manifests/window_test.py`. Five parts
(`part_hdpe_sheet`, `part_meccanixity_bracket`, `part_n20_worm_motor_16rpm`,
`part_lever_arm`, `part_paoleju_lbracket`) plus the assembly
`asm_window_test`. META rows on the motor carry the controller-software
simulation contract (voltage range, RPM, encoder CPR, gear type/self-locking)
alongside geometry params.

Iterating on this rig surfaced several real bugs and v1 improvements that
got fixed and committed in the same session:

**Mate chain composition (`src/mk/mate.py`).** The solver was writing each
inst's transform *relative to its joint_b inst* but downstream commands
interpret `INST.location` as world-frame. Single-mate assemblies happened
to work because joint_b defaulted to identity. Chains broke. Fix: track
resolved transforms per-inst in `solve_assembly`, compose
`T_a_world = T_b_world ∘ T_a_rel_to_b`. Idempotent across re-runs.

**Per-part color via `META.color`.** `mk show` now reads each part's
`META.color` and assigns it via build123d's `Shape.color = Color(...)`,
which `export_gltf` preserves through XCAF. Two underlying build123d
gotchas hit during implementation:

- `Compound([list])` (positional) leaves the NodeMixin children empty;
  must use `Compound(children=[...])` keyword form. Same fix applied to
  `export.py` for STEP/STL.
- `Color()` rejects hex strings; only accepts named colors and RGB
  floats. Added `_parse_color` helper that handles hex (`#rgb`, `#rrggbb`),
  RGB tuples, and named colors. Failures now warn to stderr instead of
  being silently swallowed.

**Lever-arm wedge geometry**. Original Box-cutter approach left the wedge
on the wrong side of the disc (cutters covered finite regions, not
half-spaces as expected). Replaced with `BuildSketch + Polyline + extrude`
producing a triangular prism — clean, deterministic. Loses ~4% area vs a
true sector at 30° sweep; invisible in the viewer.

**Wrap-around motor mount**. Bracket redesigned from L-shape (front-face
M2 mount) to a single-block clamp with through-bore for the motor body.
New `motor.body_center` joint (mid-body, faces -X) replaces `gearbox_front`
in the assembly mate. Bracket clamps around the motor body cylinder
rather than bolting to the gearbox front.

**Sheet redesigned**: 1/4" thick (was 1/2"), forest-green
(`META.color = "#2e7d32"`).

**Paoleju 2" L-bracket added** as a structural element beside the motor
mount. Crimson red (`#dc143c`). Foam stop strips removed (kept as part
definition for future variants). Final layout: white wrap-clamp around
motor body, gunmetal motor, orange lever, red L-bracket flush against
motor mount's +Z face.

**Documentation site**. New `mkdocs.yml` at repo root; `docs/`
restructured with `index.md`, `getting-started.md`, `architecture.md`,
`cli.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, `writing-parts.md` (renamed from
`writing_parts.md`), `v2_layers.md`. Renders to a static site for
`mk-cad`'s docs.

## 2026-05-09 — Mop-up + viewer overlay + bracket gets a real hole

**Mop-up of untested code paths (continue.md §8 ⚠️ items):**
- `mk export asm_demo stl` — works, 76 KB output.
- `mk export asm_demo brep` — works, 9.7 KB output.
- `mk apply nested_asm.py` — works; SUB scope produces correctly nested
  ltree paths (`asm_nested.SUB.group_a.INST.inner_a1`, etc.).
- pytest harness still unwired — needs proper packaging setup (`pip install
  -e .`); deferred.

**New CLI: `mk measure`.** Bounding boxes (overall + per-instance), joint
frames in world coords, and `--distance <jpath_a> <jpath_b>` for arbitrary
joint-to-joint measurement. Cross-checks against the manifest exactly.
Confirms the mate solver's coincidence guarantee (any rigid mate's two
joints should be 0.0 mm apart).

**Viewer overlay.** `mk show` now embeds:
- A measurement sidebar panel (top-right) with overall bbox extent, mass,
  CoM, instance bboxes, joint world-coords. Frozen at `mk show` time;
  refresh browser after each rerun.
- 3D hotspots pinned at every joint origin via `<model-viewer>`'s slot
  mechanism. Hover a dot to see the joint label.

**CSG demo.** Updated the simple_l bracket fixture to actually drill the
hole that its `hole_top` joint always implied. Builder uses
`body - (Rotation(-90,0,0) * Cylinder(d/2, h))`. Proves that the existing
builder pipeline runs arbitrary build123d expressions — no mk-cad-side
changes needed for boolean modeling. Bracket BREP changes
(`e1247b55fd62` → `6d7ebe6d08d9`); glTF grew 5917 → 6424 bytes from the
hole's curved surfaces.

**Limitation discovered during mop-up: SUB-nested mate paths.** `mate.py`'s
joint-path regex assumes flat `<asm>.INST.<inst>.JOINT.<joint>`. Nested
paths from SUB scopes (`<asm>.SUB.<sub>.INST.<inst>.JOINT.<joint>`) don't
parse. So nested assemblies with mates break at `mk build`. Logged as a
v1.x backlog item in continue.md §9; small regex + lookup fix worth doing
before §4 evaluators try it.

## 2026-05-09 — Phase 5 (mk show) — v1 complete ✅

`src/mk/commands/show.py` written. Loads BREP from cache, applies solved
locations, calls `build123d.export_gltf(compound, path)`. Also emits a small
`index.html` next to the glTF that loads it via Google's `<model-viewer>` web
component.

**Upstream surprise**: yacv 0.9.4 (the version in the `:with_yacv` upstream
tag) has no CLI. No `yacv-server` binary, no `__main__.py`, no
console-scripts entry point. The rev-2 plan to run
`yacv-server --watch /project/outputs/` was based on an API that doesn't
exist. Confirmed by inspecting `pip show yacv-server` and the package layout
inside the image.

Resolution: dropped yacv from the viewer path. `compose.yaml`'s `viewer`
service entrypoint changed to
`python -m http.server 32323 --directory /project/outputs`. `mk show`'s
emitted `index.html` does the rendering via `<model-viewer>` (CDN-loaded).
Trade-offs documented in `continue.md` §3 — no auto-reload, no rich
section/exploded views; revisit if real-world use surfaces friction.

End-to-end smoke test passes: container rebuilt, `mk show asm_demo` writes
a 5917-byte glTF + 31 KB binary buffer + 897-byte index.html; viewer
container serves both at `:32323` with HTTP 200.

The spec §14 "definition of done" sequence now runs end-to-end. v1 is
closed.

## 2026-05-08 — Licensing decision

Relicensed from rev-2's planned LGPL-2.1 + Python-aware exception to **Mozilla
Public License 2.0**. Reason: the custom exception text (necessary because
LGPL was written for the C/C++ linking model) is the kind of artisanal
license-authoring that creates ambiguity. MPL 2.0 achieves the same intent —
file-level copyleft on mk-cad source, with no friction when embedded in
proprietary work — using battle-tested terms.

Mechanical changes: `LICENSE` file added (canonical Mozilla text), SPDX
headers on all 24 source files updated `LGPL-2.1-or-later` → `MPL-2.0`,
`pyproject.toml` `license` field updated, `continue.md` §2 and `NOTICE`
amended.

## What's next

See `continue.md` (revision 3) for the forward plan: finish Phase 5, build a
small library of real test parts to exercise the API, then prioritize v2 work
based on what hurts in real use.
